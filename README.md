# Local Isosurface Modeler

<br/>
This project is for a high-fidelity surface extraction technique for volumetric (CT) scans, which is based on the paper entitled "Confidence-controlled Local Isosurfacing" (under review. minor revisions in TVCG).
Detailed "getting started" will be prepared with an example code project. 
You can download the code by using Git and cloning the repository, or downloading it as zip. This will give you the full C++ source code that you must build for yourself.
